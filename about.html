                <h2>I was born in Hayward, CA, but grew up in Jalisco, Mexico. Currently, I am 22 years old and living in Salinas, CA. Because I lived in Mexico for a long time, I know how to speak Spanish very well. I am also studying at a community college called Hartnell College to transfer to a 4-year state university and obtain a master's degree. My major is computer science, but I also take a lot of biology and chemistry classes because I am very interested in the health care sector. I have had several jobs in different sectors such as construction, agriculture, production and retail.</h2>

                <h2>Normally, I usually play a lot of video games, but I also like to do various outdoor activities such as walking, cycling, running, and various sports like soccer and basketball. Most of the time, I play video games on my Xbox, but I also play on Playstation and Switch. The games I play the most are Minecraft, Call of Duty and Forza. I also really like RPGs and strategy games. Another of my favorite hobbies is going out with friends, whether in Mexico or here.</h2>

                    <h2>I have always really liked to travel, either locally to get to know my city better or see new places, whether on foot or by car. Also, I am a big fan of the automotive world and everything related to it, such as video games or machines that work a little similarly, for example, aircraft. Because of this I know a little about mechanics and I have even helped friends and family repair their cars. I also really like listening to music at any time, whether driving, walking, cooking, etc. I don't have a favorite genre because it's always changing, but the genres I listen to the most are regional Mexican music, country and hip hop.</h2>
